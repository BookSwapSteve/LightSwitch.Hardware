A cover to go over standard sized UK Light switch.
==================================================

Composed ot two pieces.

Base:
-----
Fits behind the lightswitch, gripped to the wall by the switch.

Top:
----
Fits onto the base, ideally with magnets (not implemented yet!) to keep in place. 

Current top features a cutout and resess for a small solar panel. This can be used to charge a small battery and drive a small micro which then somehow (hopefully touch) accepts user input to switch on and off the light and communicates that to a server to control the light (e.g. a LIFX  lamp).
